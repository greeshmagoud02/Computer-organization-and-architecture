1. (a) Write a program in assembly language to print the numbers from 0 to 9.
.model small
.stack 100h
.data
.code
main proc
    mov ax, @data      ; Initialize data segment
    mov ds, ax
    mov cx, 10         ; Set loop counter to 10 for numbers 0-9
    mov dl, '0'        ; Start with ASCII character '0'
print_loop:
    mov ah, 2          ; Function to display character in DOS
    int 21h            ; Interrupt to print character in DL
    inc dl             ; Move to the next character ('0' to '9')
    loop print_loop    ; Decrement CX and loop until CX = 0
    mov ah, 4Ch        ; Exit to DOS
    int 21h
main endp
end main 
(b) Write an assembly language program to print the characters from A to Z in reverse order.
.model small
.stack 100h
.data
.code
main proc
    mov ax, @data      ; Initialize data segment
    mov ds, ax
    mov cx, 26         ; Set loop counter to 26 for letters Z to A
    mov dl, 'Z'        ; Start with ASCII character 'Z'
print_loop:
    mov ah, 2          ; Function to display character in DOS
    int 21h            ; Interrupt to print character in DL
    dec dl             ; Move to the previous character (Z to A)
    loop print_loop    ; Decrement CX and loop until CX = 0
    mov ah, 4Ch        ; Exit to DOS
    int 21h
main endp
end main
